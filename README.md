## 🧠 Major Learnings

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – React-based framework for SSR & routing
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript** – Type-safe JavaScript
- **GraphQL** – API query language
- **PWA** – Progressive Web Apps
- **React Native (Mobile Dev)** – Cross-platform mobile app development
- **System Design & Architecture**

### ✅ Best Practices & Takeaways

- Modular folder structure (Components, Pages, Services)
- Custom hooks for code reuse
- Mobile-first & accessible design
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Documentation-first mindset
- Testing with confidence (unit tests + integration tests)
